    <h2>Hii,here is the info about football : </h2>
       <pre>
            Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is the most popular sport globally. 
            It is played between two teams of 11 players on a rectangular field with a goal at each end.
            The objective is to score by getting the ball into the opposing team's goal using any part of the body except the hands and arms, except for the goalkeeper,
             who can use their hands within the penalty area.
